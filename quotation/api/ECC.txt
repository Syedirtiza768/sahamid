Changes to be concidered to secure microservices api calls

Add New api_token field under session during login

API Token can be a combination of the
	Base64(user_id) 
	First 5 characters of User Password Hash 
	UNIX Time Stamp

Match the session['api_token'] with the api token passed in the header of microservices api calls prior to making any database changes.
